## Bash Completions

You'll need to source these completions, so consider writing the completions to a file.

```

Then source that file in your `.bashrc`:

```

## Zsh Completions

To generate zsh completions:

```
mix complete.zsh
```

You'll need to save the completions as a function on the zsh `fpath`, for example:

```
mix complete.zsh > ~/.zsh/functions/_mix
```

And in the `.zshrc`:

```
fpath=(~/.zsh/functions $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```
